A: No, but it's more impressive. You can also generate during call and deliver 2-3 hours later same day.

**Q: What if the AI messes up?**
A: You can polish post-call before sending URL. The key is showing them something real-time, then perfecting it.

**Q: Should I charge for this now?**
A: No, keep it free. Speed is your competitive advantage. Free + fast = no friction.

**Q: Do clients actually care about the AI aspect?**
A: Yes! They're impressed by the speed AND interested in learning the method.

**Q: What if I'm not good with AI tools yet?**
A: Start with 24-hour delivery instead of same-call. Build up to real-time as you get faster.
