## Marketing This Training

### During Mockup Presentation

**The Hook:**
```
"You saw me generate this mockup in 45 minutes during our call. 
That wasn't magic - it's AI-powered development. I can teach your 
team to do the same thing."
```

### Value Proposition
```
"Instead of hiring consultants for every new idea, your team can 
validate concepts internally using AI. The cost of this training 
pays for itself after 2-3 projects."
```

### Objection Handling

**"We're not technical enough"**
Response: "If you can describe your process in words, AI can help you build it. No coding required - just knowing what to ask."

**"AI tools are expensive"**
Response: "ChatGPT Plus is $20/month. One external consultant hour costs more than a year of AI tools."

**"We don't have time"**
Response: "Training is 8 hours. Compare that to weeks or months you'll save on future projects."
